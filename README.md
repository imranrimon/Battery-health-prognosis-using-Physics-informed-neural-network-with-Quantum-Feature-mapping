- `dataloader/`: Data loading utilities for XJTU, MIT, HUST, and TJU datasets.
- `plotter/`: Plotting utilities.
- `utils/`: General utility functions.
- `qk/`: Quantum kernel related code.
- `main_*.py`: Main training and evaluation scripts for different datasets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.7.1
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scienceplots

## Usage
See the original README for detailed instructions on running the code.
